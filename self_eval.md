# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
* Pretty good with these as they are pretty descriptive/easy to understand what they probably do.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
* Not confident at all. I definitely want to review additional notes on writing my own methods.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
* Are methods that are defined ourselves, similar to defining "functions" in different programming languages, or is it different?
